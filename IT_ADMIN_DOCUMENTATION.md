**Document Purpose:** Technical review for IT department approval and deployment  
**Author:** David Landry  
**Date:** 2025  
**Classification:** Internal Use - Scallon Controls

## Executive Summary

File List Generator is a lightweight Windows desktop application that adds a "Generate File List" option to the Windows Explorer right-click context menu. When activated, it displays all files in the selected directory with search and sorting capabilities.

**Key Points:**
- **100% offline** - No network connectivity whatsoever
- **No installation to system directories** - Runs from any user folder
- **HKEY_CURRENT_USER registry only** - No admin privileges required
- **No data collection** - No telemetry, analytics, or phone-home features
- **Completely removable** - Clean uninstall with no residual files

---

## What Install.bat Does (Detailed)

The installation script performs THREE actions only:

### 1. Registers Context Menu for Folders
```batch
reg add "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\Directory\shell\FileListGenerator" 
    /ve /d "Generate File List" /f
reg add "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\Directory\shell\FileListGenerator" 
    /v "Icon" /t REG_SZ /d "C:\Path\To\FileListGenerator.exe,0" /f
reg add "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\Directory\shell\FileListGenerator\command" 
    /ve /d "\"C:\Path\To\FileListGenerator.exe\" \"%V\"" /f
```

### 2. Registers Context Menu for Folder Backgrounds
```batch
reg add "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\Directory\Background\shell\FileListGenerator" 
    /ve /d "Generate File List" /f
[Similar entries for icon and command]
```

### 3. Registers Context Menu for Drives
```batch
reg add "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\Drive\shell\FileListGenerator" 
    /ve /d "Generate File List" /f
[Similar entries for icon and command]
```

**IMPORTANT:** 
- All registry entries are in `HKEY_CURRENT_USER` (user-specific)
- No modifications to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE` (system-wide)
- No services installed
- No scheduled tasks created
- No startup entries added

---

## Security Analysis

### What the Program DOES:
1. **Reads directory contents** using `FindFirstFileW`/`FindNextFileW` Windows APIs
2. **Displays file information** in a standard Windows ListView control
3. **Responds to user input** (searching, sorting, opening files)
4. **Copies text to clipboard** when user clicks Copy button

### What the Program DOES NOT DO:
- ❌ **No network connections** - No socket creation, no HTTP requests
- ❌ **No file modifications** - Read-only access to file system
- ❌ **No registry monitoring** - Only reads command-line arguments
- ❌ **No process injection** - Runs in its own process space
- ❌ **No driver installation** - Purely user-mode application
- ❌ **No data persistence** - No configuration files or databases
- ❌ **No auto-updates** - No mechanism to download or modify itself

### Permissions Required:
- Read access to directories (same as Windows Explorer)
- Write to clipboard (when user requests copy)
- Create window (standard GUI application)

---

## How the Program Works

### Execution Flow:
1. **Launch:** Windows Explorer passes folder path as command-line argument
2. **Scan:** Program uses Windows `walkdir` API to enumerate files
3. **Display:** Results shown in virtual ListView (memory efficient)
4. **Search:** Real-time filtering in memory (no temp files)
5. **Exit:** Clean shutdown, no background processes remain

### Memory Usage:
- Typical: 10-20 MB RAM
- Scales with directory size (approximately 1KB per 10 files)
- Virtual list view prevents excessive memory use

### Performance Impact:
- CPU: Minimal (only during initial scan)
- Disk I/O: Read-only directory traversal
- No background activity when not in use

## Complete Uninstallation Process

### Method 1: Using Uninstall.bat
```batch
# Removes all three registry entries:
reg delete "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\Directory\shell\FileListGenerator" /f
reg delete "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\Directory\Background\shell\FileListGenerator" /f  
reg delete "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\Drive\shell\FileListGenerator" /f
```

### Method 2: Manual Registry Cleanup
1. Open Registry Editor (`regedit.exe`)
2. Navigate to `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\Directory\shell\`
3. Delete `FileListGenerator` key
4. Navigate to `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\Directory\Background\shell\`
5. Delete `FileListGenerator` key
6. Navigate to `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\Drive\shell\`
7. Delete `FileListGenerator` key
8. Delete program files from installation directory

### Verification of Complete Removal:
- No remaining registry entries
- No files in Windows, System32, or Program Files
- No services or scheduled tasks
- Context menu option disappears immediately

## Antivirus Considerations

### Why False Positives May Occur:
1. **Unsigned executable** - Not digitally signed with certificate
2. **Registry modification** - Adds context menu entries
3. **New/uncommon file** - Low prevalence in AV databases
4. **Rust compiled binary** - Less common than C++ applications

### Mitigation Steps:
1. **Whitelist by hash:**
   ```
   SHA256: [Will be provided with distribution]
   MD5: [Will be provided with distribution]
   ```

2. **Whitelist by path:**
   ```
   C:\Tools\FileListGenerator\FileListGenerator.exe
   ```

3. **Submit for analysis:**
   - Windows Defender: Submit sample via Security Intelligence
   - VirusTotal: Scan to verify with 70+ antivirus engines

---

## Testing Recommendations

### Phase 1: Isolated Testing
1. Test on non-production VM first
2. Verify registry changes with before/after comparison
3. Run full antivirus scan
4. Test all features (search, sort, copy, open)

### Phase 2: Limited Deployment  
1. Deploy to IT department machines
2. Monitor for 1 week
3. Check Windows Event Viewer for any issues
4. Verify no performance impact

### Phase 3: Production Rollout
1. Create deployment package with your preferred method
2. Include in approved software list
3. Document in IT knowledge base

### Key Files for Security Review:
- `src/main.rs` - Program entry point and argument handling
- `src/gui.rs` - Windows GUI implementation
- `src/scanner.rs` - Directory scanning logic
- `src/filter.rs` - Search filtering
- `Cargo.toml` - Dependencies (all are standard Rust/Windows crates)

### Building from Source:
```bash
# Requires Rust toolchain and Windows SDK
cargo build --release
```

## Recommendation for IT Approval

This application poses **minimal security risk** because:

1. **No network capability** - Cannot exfiltrate data
2. **No persistent storage** - Cannot hide malicious payloads
3. **User-mode only** - Cannot compromise system integrity
4. **Read-only operations** - Cannot damage files
5. **Transparent operation** - All actions visible to user
6. **Clean uninstall** - Completely removable

**Suggested Deployment Classification:** Low Risk - Productivity Tool
